# Motoko Bootcamp - DAO Adventure

> This repository contains a list of all the repositories in the Motoko Bootcamp DAO Adventure.

## Motivation

A DAO, which stands for Decentralized Autonomous Organization, is a new type of organization (or company) that runs leveraging blockchain technology. This enables us to create more transparent, trusted and efficient organisations.

**DAOs** are the biggest innovation in the field of governance since the invention of the [LLC](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/llc.asp) or perhaps even democracy itself. Just like the **steam engine** made the **Industrial Revolution** possible by harnessing **physical powe**r, DAOs harness **political power** and make a Web3 revolution possible. This could fundamentally change how we organize resources, people and capital with the end goal of creating a more stable, flourishing, collaborative and fair civilisation.

## What is the DAO Adventure?

The **DAO Adventure** is a **free** and **open source** educational program designed to help you learn about 3 fundamental topics:

- The [Internet Computer](internetcomputer.org): the first decentralized cloud, enabling on-chain hosting of websites and fullstack applications.
- The [Motoko language](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YIBRI-1RJs): a new programming language designed for the Internet Computer. It is native to the Internet Computer and optimized for building directly on the blockchain.
- **DAOs**: a new type of organization (or company) that runs leveraging blockchain technology. This enables us to create more transparent, trusted and efficient organisations.

The **DAO adventure\*** is divided into 3 phases:

- **Initiation Phase**: you will learn the basics of Web3, the Internet Computer and deploy your first application.
- **Training Phase**: you will dive into DAOs and master the Motoko language.
- **Graduation Phase**: you will prove your skills by building and deploying your own micro-DAO on the Internet Computer.

The **DAO Adventure** is a gamified experience. You will be able to automatically record your progression through the [Motoko Bootcamp Dashboard](https://www.motokobootcamp.com/).
