## Motivation üí≠

A DAO, which stands for Decentralized Autonomous Organization, is a new type of organization (or company) that runs leveraging blockchain technology. This enables us to create more transparent, trusted and efficient organisations.

**DAOs**¬†are the biggest innovation in the field of governance since the invention of the¬†[LLC](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/llc.asp)¬†or perhaps even democracy itself. Just like the¬†**steam engine**¬†made the¬†**Industrial Revolution**¬†possible by harnessing **physical powe**r, DAOs harness¬†**political power**¬†and make a Web3 revolution possible. This could fundamentally change how we organize resources, people and capital with the end goal of creating a more stable, flourishing, collaborative and fair civilisation.

- The [Internet Computer](internetcomputer.org): the first decentralized cloud, enabling on-chain hosting of websites and fullstack applications.
- The [Motoko language](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YIBRI-1RJs): a new programming language designed for the Internet Computer. It is native to the Internet Computer and optimized for building directly on the blockchain.
- [DAOs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbkNVP_hlfY): a new type of organization (or company) that runs leveraging blockchain technology. This enables us to create more transparent, trusted and efficient organisations.
